              My very first coding project! I built this as a final project for
              the SheCodes Basic workshop. Although it's just a basic landing
              page built with HTML, JavaScript and CSS, I have tried to improve
              on it with the new things that I've learned since I first built
              it.

              I built this weather app as my SheCodes Plus final project. When I
              built it, it was not responsive, but I have worked on it a bit
              more using the responsive skills that I recently acquired. It was
              built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is fully functional and
              can be used to check the weather forecast of any city in the
              world.

              I had so much fun building this dictionary app with React JSX.
              Styled with CSS and integrated a dictionary API which it uses to
              call the definitions, phonectics (audio and text) and so on. It is
              fully functional, just like any dictionary out there-only just a
              bit more stylish ðŸ˜„. It goes a notch higher by providing visuals
              via another API. Please check it out.
